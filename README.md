### Contents

| Directory  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `SN1/` | files for computing the EIE of glucose cation formation over many conformers |
| `SN2/` | files for computing the KIE for SN2 glycosylation via bridged transition states |
| `theory/` | dependence of transition structure on choice of DFT|
| `diffuse/` | effect of adding minimal diffuse functions to oxygens near reaction site |

Please note that reproducing the KIE calculations will require a working copy of [PyQuiver](https://www.github.com/ekwan/PyQuiver).  All directories are meant to be used in a Linux-like environment where tools like `awk`, `sed`, and `bash` are available.
