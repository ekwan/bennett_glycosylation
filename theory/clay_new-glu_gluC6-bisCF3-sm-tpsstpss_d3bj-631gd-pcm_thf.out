      HUMANKIND PERIODICALLY GOES THROUGH A SPEEDUP OF ITS AFFAIRS, 
      THEREBY EXPERIENCING THE RACE BETWEEN THE RENEWABLE VITALITY
      OF THE LIVING, AND THE BECKONING VITIATION OF DECADENCE.
      IN THIS PERIODIC RACE, ANY PAUSE BECOMES A LUXURY.
      ONLY THEN CAN ONE REFLECT THAT ALL IS PERMITTED;
      ALL IS POSSIBLE.
