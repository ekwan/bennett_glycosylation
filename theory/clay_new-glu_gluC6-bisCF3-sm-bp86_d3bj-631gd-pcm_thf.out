 10 WHATSOEVER THY HAND FINDETH TO DO, DO IT WITH THY  
 MIGHT. FOR THERE IS NO WORK, NOR DEVICE, NOR KNOWLEDGE, NOR  
 WISDOM, IN THE GRAVE, WHITHER THOU GOEST.                    
 11 I RETURNED AND SAW UNDER THE SUN, THAT THE RACE IS NOT TO 
 THE SWIFT, NOR THE BATTLE TO THE STRONG, NEITHER YET BREAD TO
 THE WISE, NOR YET RICHES TO MEN OF UNDERSTANDING, NOR YET    
 FAVOR TO MEN OF SKILL. BUT TIME AND CHANCE HAPPEN TO THEM ALL.
 12 FOR MAN ALSO KNOWETH NOT HIS TIME. AS THE FISHES   
 THAT ARE TAKEN IN AN EVIL NET, AND AS THE BIRDS THAT ARE     
 CAUGHT IN THE SNARE. SO ARE THE SONS OF MEN SNARED IN AN EVIL
 TIME, WHEN IT FALLETH SUDDENLY UPON THEM.
