 BUT 'GLORY' DOESN'T MEAN 'A NICE KNOCK DOWN ARGUMENT', ALICE OBJECTED.
 WHEN I USE A WORD, HUMPTY DUMPTY SAID, IN A RATHER SCORNFUL TONE,
 IT MEANS JUST WHAT I CHOOSE IT TO MEAN....
 NEITHER MORE NOR LESS....
 THE QUESTION IS, SAID ALICE,
 WHETHER YOU CAN MAKE WORDS MEAN SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS...
 THE QUESTION IS, SAID HUMPTY DUMPTY,
 WHICH IS TO BE MASTER....
 THAT IS ALL.....
